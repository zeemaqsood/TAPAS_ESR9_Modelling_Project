# TAPAS_ESR9_Modelling_Project

Netlogo (agent-based modelling approach) and MATLAB (deterministic, ordinary differential equations-based modelling approach) scripts for studying the effect of varying parameters on output such as receptor dimerisation and higher order clustering. 

These scripts were used to investigate the effect of valency of the ligand with varying diffusion coefficients, on a single transmembrane receptor. Various other parameters were also tested in addition to ligand valency, such as basal phosphorylation rate of receptors, dimerisation of receptors, inter-dimerisation of two dimers via a crosslinking species and the spatial effect of clusters on the rate of dephosphorylation of receptors within the clusters.

Both scripts provide graphical outputs. Netlogo additionally provides an option to download data from a single or multiple runs in a tabular form or a csv file.
